1. I am a **hard working** and **committed** person.
2. I am *reliable* and *dependable*.
3. I am a quick learner and **_quite_** intelligent.
4. I love software and programming in general. It is my _vocation_ and my _hobby_ and it is a bonus that I get paid to do what I would only be doing anyway if I wasn't doing it in my day job.
5. I particularly enjoy working with the following:
   1. Linux - Ubuntu 18.04, but running Lubuntu display manager as it is less resource hungry
   2. VMWare Workstation 15 - allows me to run Linux simultaneusly on top of my work's Windows and allows me to port over my development environment to any hardware or operating system change that is imposed on me by my work.
   3. Neovim - an awesome editor for writing the code that realises my vision.
