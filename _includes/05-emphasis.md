### Personal Characteristics

1. I am a **hard working** and **committed** person.
2. I am *reliable* and *dependable*.
3. I am a quick learner and **_quite_** intelligent.
4. I love software and programming in general. It is my _vocation_ and my _hobby_ and it is a bonus that I get paid to do what I would only be doing anyway if I wasn't doing it in my day job.

### Particular Interests
   1. Linux - Ubuntu 18.04, but running Lubuntu display manager as it is less resource hungry
   2. VMWare Workstation 15 - allows me to run Linux OS simultaneously on top of my work's Windows OS and allows me to port over my development environment to any hardware or operating system change that is imposed on me by my work.
   3. Neovim - an awesome editor for writing the code that realises my ambitions to develop meaningful applications for an assortement of ideas.
   4. Git / GitHub - and now GitHub Pages!
   5. Heroku
   5. HTML5 / CSS / Javascript / Ruby on Rails
   6. FreeCodeCamp
   7. The Odin Project
   8. Harvard CS50
   9. Automation - __automating everything possible__ and being one of the contributors to this movement outside of the industrial automation space that I have traditionally worked in over the last 20 years or so.
